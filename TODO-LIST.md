# Just a list of things to get done on this project at a high level overview

1. Introduction/splash page
2. Build/version numbering on bottom footer (about page maybe?)
3. Contact Page
   1. Links to Github page, linkedIn Page
4. Blog page
   1. Post about getting back into the saddle?
   2. Post about what's new in Angular versions? Seems like a nice way to get clicks and recognition (at least a little bit)
5. Projects Page 
   1. Component library 
   2. Ionic Mobile Apps

* [ ] Push this project up to GitHub for src code management
* [x] light/dark mode (still needs work but foundation is set)
* [x] Fonts/Typography - Setup Second (still needs work but foundation is set)
* [ ] Theme - Do theme-ing *after* setting up a coherent **main** theme.
* [ ] Layout 
* [ ] Idea for Projects page -> Parallax photo (Forest trees looking up) to project the "forrest for the trees" kind of vibe.
* [ ] Switchable themes/fonts? Seems like a fun idea for showing off skill set.
* [ ] Get a favicon going
* [ ] Project idea - Theme builder for Angular Project/website - Color picker on components and then you build it out.
